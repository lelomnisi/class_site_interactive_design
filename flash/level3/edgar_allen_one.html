<div>By a route obscure and lonely,   
Haunted by ill angels only, 
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT, <br>  
On a black throne reigns upright, 
I have reached these lands but newly   
From an ultimate dim Thule— <br>
From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime, 
       Out of SPACE—Out of TIME. </div>
<br><br><br>
<div class="hey">Bottomless vales and boundless floods,   
And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,   
With forms that no man can discover  <br> 
For the tears that drip all over;   
Mountains toppling evermore   
Into seas without a shore; <br>  
Seas that restlessly aspire,   
Surging, unto skies of fire;   
Lakes that endlessly outspread <br>  
Their lone waters—lone and dead,—   
Their still waters—still and chilly   
With the snows of the lolling lily. </div>
<br><br><br>
<div class="happy">By the lakes that thus outspread <br>
Their lone waters, lone and dead,— 
Their sad waters, sad and chilly <br><br>
With the snows of the lolling lily,— 
By the mountains—near the river  <br> <br>
Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,—   
By the grey woods,—by the swamp  <br> 
Where the toad and the newt encamp,—  <br> 
By the dismal tarns and pools 
   Where dwell the Ghouls,— <br>  
By each spot the most unholy—   
In each nook most melancholy,—  <br><br>
There the traveller meets, aghast,<br>   
Sheeted Memories of the Past—  <br> 
Shrouded forms that start and sigh   
As they pass the wanderer by—  <br><br>
White-robed forms of friends long given,<br>   
In agony, to the Earth—and Heaven. </div>
<br><br><br>
<div class="good">For the heart whose woes are legion   
’T is a peaceful, soothing region—   
For the spirit that walks in shadow <br>  
’T is—oh, ’t is an Eldorado! <br>
But the traveller, travelling through it,   
May not—dare not openly view it;   <br>
Never its mysteries are exposed <br>  
To the weak human eye unclosed;   
So wills its King, who hath forbid <br>  
The uplifting of the fring'd lid;   
And thus the sad Soul that here passes <br>  
Beholds it but through darkened glasses.</div>
<br><br><br>
<div class="time">By a route obscure and lonely,   
Haunted by ill angels only, <br>
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT, 
On a black throne reigns upright,<br>   
I have wandered home but newly   
From this ultimate dim Thule.<br><br></div>
