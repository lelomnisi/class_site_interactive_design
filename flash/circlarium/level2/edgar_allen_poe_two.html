 <h1>Dream-Land
<br>
by Edgar Allan Poe
<br>
(published 1844)<h1/>
  
<br>
<br>
<br>
    <p><ul><li>By a route <li>obscure and<li> lonely,<br></li>
    <li>Haunted</li> by ill angels only,<br></li>
    <li>Where an</li> Eidolon,<li> named NIGHT,<br></li>
    <li>On a </li>black throne<li> reigns upright,<br></li>
    <li>I have reached these lands but newly<br></li>
    <li>From an </li>ultimate <li>dim Thule --<br></li>
    <li>From a </li>wild weird <li>clime that lieth, sublime,<br></li>
         <li> Out of SPACE -- out of TIME.</li></ul><p/>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    <p>Bottomless vales and boundless floods,<br>
    And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,<br>
    With forms that no man can discover<br>
    For the dews that drip all over;<br>
    Mountains toppling evermore<br>
    Into seas without a shore;<br>
    Seas that restlessly aspire,<br>
    Surging, unto skies of fire;<br>
    Lakes that endlessly outspread<br>
    Their lone waters -- lone and dead, --<br>
    Their still waters -- still and chilly<br>
    With the snows of the lolling lily.<p/>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    <p>By the lakes that thus outspread<br>
    Their lone waters, lone and dead, --<br>
    Their sad waters, sad and chilly<br>
    With the snows of the lolling lily, --<br>
    By the mountains -- near the river<br>
    Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever, --<br>
    By the grey woods, -- by the swamp<br>
    Where the toad and the newt encamp, --<br>
    By the dismal tarns and pools<br>
      <br><br> Where dwell the Ghouls, --<br>
    By each spot the most unholy<br> --<br>
    In each nook most melancholy,<br> --<br>
    There the traveller meets aghast<br>
    Sheeted Memories of the Past <br>--<br>
    Shrouded forms that start and sigh<br>
    As they pass the wanderer by<br> --<br>
    White-robed forms of friends long given,<br>
    In agony, to the Earth<br><br> --<br><br> and Heaven.<p/>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    <p>For the heart whose woes are legion<br>
    'Tis a peaceful, soothing region<br> <br>--<br><br>
    For the spirit that walks in shadow<br>
    'Tis -- oh 'tis an Eldorado!<br>
    But the traveller, travelling through it,<br>
    May not -- dare not openly view it;<br>
    Never its mysteries are exposed<br>
    To the weak human eye unclosed;<br>
    So wills its King, who hath forbid<br>
    The uplifting of the fringed lid;<br>
    And thus the sad Soul that here passes<br>
    Beholds it but through darkened glasses.</>
<br>

    <h4><ul>
    <li>By a route obscure and lonely,</li><br>
    <li>Haunted by ill angels only,</li> <br>
    <li>Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,<br></li>
    <li>On a black throne reigns upright,</li><br>
    <li>I have wandered home but newly<br></li>
    <li>From this ultimate dim Thule.</li></ul><h4/>
