<div id="box1"><h4> By a route obscure and lonely,   
Haunted by ill angels only, 
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,   
On a <br>black throne <br> reigns upright, 
I have reached these lands but newly   
From an ultimate dim Thule— 
From a<br> wild<br> weird clime that lieth, sublime, 
       Out of SPACE—Out of TIME.<h4/> 
</div>
<div id="box2"><h4>Bottomless vales<br> and boundless floods,   
And chasms, and caves,<br> and Titan woods,   
With<br> forms that no man can discover   
For the tears that drip all over;   
Mountains<br> toppling evermore   
Into seas without a shore;   
Seas that restlessly<br> aspire,   
Surging, unto skies of fire;   
Lakes <br>that<br> endlessly outspread   
Their lone waters—lone and dead,—   
Their still waters—still and chilly   
With the snows of the <br>lolling lily.<h4/></div> 

<div id="box3"><h4>By the lakes that thus outspread 
Their lone waters, lone and dead,— 
Their<br> sad waters, sad and chilly 
With the<br> snows of the lolling lily,— 
By the mountains—near the <br>river   
Murmuring lowly,<br> murmuring ever,—   
By the grey woods,—by the swamp   
Where the<br> toad and <br>the newt encamp,—   
By the dismal tarns and pools 
 <br>  Where dwell the Ghouls,—   
By each spot <br>the most unholy—   
In each nook most melancholy,—   
There the traveller meets, aghast,   
Sheeted<br> Memories<br> of the Past—   
Shrouded forms that start and sigh   
As they pass the<br> wanderer by—   
White-robed forms of <br>friends long given,   
In agony,<br> to the Earth—and Heaven.<h4/></div> 

<div id="box4"><h4>For the heart whose woes are legion   
’T is a peaceful, soothing region—   
For the spirit that walks<br> in shadow   
’T is—oh, ’t<br> is an Eldorado! 
But the traveller, travelling through it,   
May<br> not—dare<br> not openly<br> view it;   
Never its mysteries are exposed   
To the <br>weak human<br> eye unclosed;   
So wills its King, who hath forbid   
The<br> uplifting<br> of the fring'd lid;   
And thus the sad Soul<br> that here passes   
Beholds it but<br> through darkened<br> glasses.<h4/></div> 

<div id="box5"><h4>By a route <br>obscure and lonely,   
Haunted <br>by ill angels only, 
Where an Eidolon, named<br> NIGHT, 
On a black <br>throne reigns upright,   
I have wandered home but newly   
From <br>this ultimate <br>dim Thule.<h4/></div>
