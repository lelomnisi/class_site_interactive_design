<p><center>Dream-Land</p>
<br>
<p>by Edgar Allan Poe<p>
<br> (published 1844)<center/></h1>
<p><center>By a route obscure and lonely,
    Haunted by ill angels only,<br>
    Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
    <br>
    On a black throne reigns upright,<br>
    I have reached these lands but newly
    From an ultimate dim Thule --<br>
    From a wild weird clime that lieth,<br> sublime,
          Out of SPACE -- out of TIME.
<br>
<br>
<br>
    Bottomless vales and boundless floods,<br>
    And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,<br>
    With forms that no man can discover
    For the dews that drip all over;<br>
    Mountains toppling evermore
    Into seas without a shore;<br>
    Seas that restlessly aspire,
    Surging, unto skies of fire;<br>
    Lakes that endlessly outspread
    Their lone waters -- lone and dead, --<br>
    Their still waters -- still and chilly
    With the snows of the lolling lily.
<br>
<br>
<br>
    By the lakes that thus outspread
    Their lone waters, lone and dead, --<br>
    Their sad waters, sad and chilly
    With the snows of the lolling lily, --<br>
    By the mountains -- near the river
    Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever, --<br>
    By the grey woods, -- by the swamp
    Where the toad and the newt encamp, --<br>
    By the dismal tarns and pools
            Where dwell the Ghouls, --<br>
    By each spot the most unholy --
    In each nook most melancholy, --<br>
    There the traveller meets aghast
    Sheeted Memories of the Past --<br>
    Shrouded forms that start and sigh
    As they pass the wanderer by --<br>
    White-robed forms of friends long given,
    In agony, to the Earth -- and Heaven.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    For the heart whose woes are legion
    'Tis a peaceful, soothing region --<br>
    For the spirit that walks in shadow
    'Tis -- oh 'tis an Eldorado!<br>
    But the traveller, travelling through it,
    May not -- dare not openly view it;<br>
    Never its mysteries are exposed
    To the weak human eye unclosed;<br>
    So wills its King, who hath forbid
    The uplifting of the fringed lid;<br>
    And thus the sad Soul that here passes
    Beholds it but through darkened glasses.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    By a route obscure and lonely,
    Haunted by ill angels only, <br>
    Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
    On a black throne reigns upright,
    I have wandered home but newly<br>
    From this ultimate dim Thule. <center/></p>
