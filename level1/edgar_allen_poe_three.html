<p><center>Dream-Land
<br>
by Edgar Allan Poe
<br> (published 1844)<center/><p/>
<p align="right"> By a route obscure and lonely,<br>
    Haunted by ill angels only,<br>
    Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,<br>
    On a black throne reigns upright,<br>
    I have reached these lands but newly<br>
    From an ultimate dim Thule --<br>
    From a wild weird clime that lieth,<br> sublime,
          Out of SPACE -- out of TIME.<br><p/>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    <p align="left"> Bottomless vales and boundless floods,<br>
    And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,<br>
    With forms that no man can discover<br>
    For the dews that drip all over;<br>
    Mountains toppling evermore<br>
    Into seas without a shore;<br>
    Seas that restlessly aspire,<br>
    Surging, unto skies of fire;<br>
    Lakes that endlessly outspread<br>
    Their lone waters -- lone and dead, --<br>
    Their still waters -- still and chilly<br>
    With the snows of the lolling lily.<br><p/>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    <p><center>By the lakes that thus outspread<br>
    Their lone waters, lone and dead, --<br>
    Their sad waters, sad and chilly<br>
    With the snows of the lolling lily, --<br>
    By the mountains -- near the river<br>
    Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever, --<br>
    By the grey woods, -- by the swamp<br>
    Where the toad and the newt encamp, --<br>
    By the dismal tarns and pools<br>
            Where dwell the Ghouls, --<br>
    By each spot the most unholy --<br>
    In each nook most melancholy, --<br>
    There the traveller meets aghast<br>
    Sheeted Memories of the Past --<br>
    Shrouded forms that start and sigh<br>
    As they pass the wanderer by --<br>
    White-robed forms of friends long given,<br>
    In agony, to the Earth -- and Heaven.<br><center/><p/>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    <p align="right">For the heart whose woes are legion<br>
    'Tis a peaceful, soothing region --<br>
    For the spirit that walks in shadow<br>
    'Tis -- oh 'tis an Eldorado!<br>
    But the traveller, travelling through it,<br>
    May not -- dare not openly view it;<br>
    Never its mysteries are exposed<br>
    To the weak human eye unclosed;<br>
    So wills its King, who hath forbid<br>
    The uplifting of the fringed lid;<br>
    And thus the sad Soul that here passes<br>
    Beholds it but through darkened glasses.<br><p/>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    <p><center>By a route obscure and lonely,<br>
    Haunted by ill angels only, <br>
    Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,<br>
    On a black throne reigns upright,<br>
    I have wandered home but newly<br>
    From this ultimate dim Thule. <center/></p>
