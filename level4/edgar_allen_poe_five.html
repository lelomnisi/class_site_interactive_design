<h1>Edgar Allen<br> Poe<h1/>
<h2>DREAMLAND<h2/>
<div><p>By a route obscure and lonely,   
Haunted by ill angels only, 
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,   
On a black throne reigns upright, 
I have reached these lands but newly   
From an ultimate dim Thule— 
From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime, 
       Out of SPACE—Out of TIME.<br><br></div>

Bottomless<br><br> vales and boundless floods, <br><br>  
And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods, <br>  
With forms <br><br>that no man can discover  <br> 
For the tears that drip all over;   
Mountains toppling<br><br> evermore <br><br>  
Into<br><br><br> seas<br> without<br> a shore;  <br> 
Seas that restlessly aspire,   
Surging, unto skies of fire;   <br>
Lakes that <br><br>endlessly outspread   
Their <br><br>lone waters—lone and dead,—<br><br>   
Their still<br><br> waters<br><br>—still and chilly   
With the snows of the lolling lily.<br><br>
<br><br>
By the lakes that thus outspread <br><br>
Their lone waters, lone and dead,— 
Their sad waters,<br><br> sad and chilly <br><br>
With the <br><br>snows of the lolling lily,— 
By the mountains—near the river   
Murmuring <br><br>lowly, murmuring ever,—   
By the grey woods,—by the swamp   <br><br>
Where the toad and the newt encamp,—   
By the dismal<br><br> tarns and pools 
   Where dwell the Ghouls,—   <br><br>
By each <br><br>spot the most unholy—   
In each nook most melancholy,—   <br><br>
There the traveller meets, aghast,   
Sheeted Memories of the Past—   <br><br>
Shrouded forms that start and sigh   
As they <br><br>pass the <br><br><br>wanderer by—   
White-robed forms of friends long given,   
In agony, to the Earth—and Heaven.
<br><br>
For the heart whose woes are legion   
’T is a peaceful, soothing region—   
For the spirit that walks in shadow   
’T is—oh, ’t is an Eldorado! 
But the traveller, travelling through it,   
May not—dare not openly view it;   
Never its mysteries are exposed   
To the weak human eye unclosed;   
So wills its King, who hath forbid   <br><br>
The uplifting of the fring'd lid;   
And thus the sad Soul that here passes   
Beholds it but through darkened glasses.
<br><br>
By a route obscure and lonely, <br><br>  
Haunted by ill angels only, 
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT, 
On a black throne<br><br> reigns upright,   
I have wandered home but newly   
From this ultimate dim Thule.</p>
