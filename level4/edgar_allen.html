<h1>Edgar Allen<br> Poe<h1/>
<h2>DREAMLAND<h2/>
<br>
<p>By a route obscure and lonely,   
Haunted <br> <br> by ill angels only,<br> 
Where<br> <br>  an Eidolon, named NIGHT,   <br> <br> 
<br> <br> On <br> <br> a black throne reigns upright, 
I have<br> <br>  reached <br> <br> these lands but newly   
<br> <br> From an ultimate dim Thule— <br> <br> 
From a <br> <br> wild weird clime that lieth, sublime, 
       Out of SPACE—Out of TIME.<br> <br> 

<br> <br> Bottomless vales and boundless floods,  <br>  
And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,   
With forms that no man can discover   
For the tears that drip all over;   <br> 
Mountains<br>  toppling<br>  evermore   
Into seas without a shore;   <br> <br> 
Seas that restlessly aspire, <br>   
Surging, unto skies of fire;   
Lakes that endlessly outspread   
Their lone waters—lone and dead,—   
Their still waters—still and chilly   
With the snows of the lolling lily. 

<br> By the lakes that thus outspread <br> <br> 
Their lone waters,<br> <br>  lone and dead,— 
Their sad <br> waters, sad and chilly 
With <br> the <br> snows<br> <br>  of the lolling lily,— 
By the mountains—near the river   
<br> <br> Murmuring <br> <br> lowly, murmuring ever,—   
By the <br> <br> grey woods,—by the swamp   <br> <br> 
Where the toad <br> <br> and the newt encamp,—   
By the dismal tarns and pools 
 <br> <br>   Where dwell the <br> <br> <br> <br> Ghouls,—   
By each spot the most unholy—   
In each<br> <br>  nook most<br> <br> <br> <br>  melancholy,—   
There<br> <br>  the traveller meets, aghast,   
Sheeted Memories <br> <br> of the Past—   
Shrouded forms that start <br> <br> and sigh   
<br> <br> As they pass the wanderer by—   <br> <br> 
White-robed forms <br> <br> <br> of friends long given,   
In agony, to the Earth—and Heaven. 
<br> <br> 
For the heart whose woes <br> are legion   
’T is a peaceful,<br>  soothing region—   
For the<br> <br> <br>  spirit that<br> <br>  walks in <br> <br> shadow <br> <br>   
’T is—oh,<br>  ’t is an Eldorado! 
But the traveller, travelling <br> <br> through it,   
<br> <br> May not—dare not openly view it;   
Never its mysteries <br> <br> are exposed   
To <br> <br> the weak human<br>  eye <br> unclosed;  <br> <br>  
So wills <br> <br> its King, who hath forbid   
<br> <br> The uplifting of <br> <br> the fring'd lid;   
And thus the sad Soul that here passes <br> <br>   
<br> <br> Beholds<br> <br>  it but <br> <br> through darkened glasses. <br> <br> 

By a<br> <br>  route <br> <br> obscure and lonely,   
<br> Haunted by ill<br> <br>  angels only, <br> <br> 
<br> <br> <br> Where<br> <br>  an Eidolon,<br> <br>  named NIGHT, 
On a black throne reigns upright, <br> <br>   
I <br> <br> have<br> <br>  wandered <br> <br> home but newly   
From this ultimate dim Thule.</p>
